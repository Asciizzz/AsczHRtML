A working ray tracing engine made in HTML, what the actual fuck is wrong with me

---

### Guide, I guess?

Open the html file, that's LITERALLY IT

Press 4, press Load Texture, throw in the sky texture you want
Press other things and stuffs to do other cool shits

Use mouse, keyboard and shit to move around and see things, idk?

Press Q to render a high quality image instead, do keep in mind you are unable to look around with camera otherwise your pc goes to fucking belige
Oh yea press Save Image to, idk, do whatever the fuck it literally said?
