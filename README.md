A working ray tracing engine made in HTML, what the actual fuck is wrong with me

### Guide, I guess?

Open the html file, that's LITERALLY IT, you don't even need internet.

Press 4, then press Load Texture, throw in the sky texture you want
Press other things and stuffs to do other cool shits.

Use mouse, keyboard and shit to move around and see things, idk?

Press Q to render a high quality image instead, do keep in mind you are unable to look around with camera in that state, otherwise your pc goes to fucking belige.

Oh yea press Save Image to save that specific frame as .png

Peace!
